# Changelog

## Unreleased

- **Changed: bare `schemagate` opens the demo.** It opened the Studio on
  nothing -- a blank page waiting for a URL -- so every fresh install landed
  on an empty screen. It now opens on the bundled 42-object demo, unless a
  connection has been remembered with `--remember`, which still wins.
  `schemagate studio` with no flags is unchanged and still starts empty.

- **Added: row-level policies are read, probed, and named.** `restrict_from_grants`
  answered who holds `SELECT`; a row-level policy can answer "no rows" for a
  caller who holds it, and every dictionary answer is identical for a reader
  who gets rows and one who gets none (measured on PostgreSQL 16 and Oracle
  26ai, `docs/row-level-security.md`). `schemagate.rls.restrict_from_policies`
  now runs after the grants on every path that reads them: a policied object
  is flagged and its DDL says rows are filtered per caller; on PostgreSQL each
  role the grants left is `SET ROLE`d and asked for one row, and a role that
  gets nothing loses the object as a missing grant would; and a view over a
  policied table that is not `security_invoker` -- which hands the caller the
  owner's rows -- is named in the report, with `hide_bypassing_views=True` to
  drop it from the catalogue. A role the connection cannot become is kept and reported,
  never silently denied. Nothing changes in a prompt for an object without a
  policy.

## 0.1.58

- **Fixed: the version a client is told in `initialize` is schemagate's, not
  the SDK's.** FastMCP 1.x built its low-level server with no version, and
  the SDK filled in its own package version -- `''` in the published image,
  `1.27.0` in-process. Both SDK majors now report `schemagate/<version>`,
  and a test asks a real stdio client to check.

- **Added: where a caller's roles come from.** `restrict_from_grants` read
  which roles may see an object from the database; the roles the caller
  *held* were still whatever the caller said, which on a hosted MCP server
  is not a check. A `groups` block in the catalog config now resolves them
  from a directory (Microsoft Entra ID through Graph, transitive), the
  database's own role graph (`native`, the same views the grant reader
  uses, walked upward from the user), a membership table (`sql`), any HTTP
  endpoint, or a static map — and the roles in a request are ignored once
  it is configured. Fails closed: a directory that cannot answer is an error
  to that caller, never an anonymous selection. Verified live on PostgreSQL
  16, MySQL 8.4 and Oracle Autonomous Database 26ai. `docs/groups.md`.

- **Added: it learns from SQL that ran.** A question answered correctly once
  is the best evidence about how to answer it next time -- not a guess about
  the schema, a query that executed against it. When `answer` (MCP), `--answer`
  (CLI) or the Studio produces a SELECT that runs, the question and the query
  are remembered, never the rows. A later similar question gets that query's
  tables pinned into its selection and the pair shown as a worked example.
  Neither widens what a caller sees: pins pass the same visibility gate as any
  pin, and an example is shown only when every table it names is visible to
  that caller; every stored query is re-checked read-only on the way in and
  out, and a tampered file is refused on load. Memory-only unless
  `SCHEMAGATE_MEMORY` names a file. With nothing remembered the prompt is
  byte-identical to before -- the bench gate did not move. `learn_from_audit`
  turns an audit log into a training set.

- **Added: an audit log of every identity decision.** Each call to
  `select_schema`, `list_objects`, `describe_object`, `run_query` and `answer`
  now writes one JSON record -- principal, roles, question, what was shown,
  how much was withheld, the SQL and its row count, and any refusal with its
  reason. Three things it never holds: row data, the names of withheld
  columns, the database URL. Memory-only (last 500, counted in `health`)
  unless `SCHEMAGATE_AUDIT_LOG` names a file, which then rotates at 50 MB. A
  failed write is counted and never surfaces to the caller. Not exposed as a
  tool, on purpose. The record for a refused `describe_object` says whether
  the object was restricted or missing; the reply to the caller still does
  not, and a test pins both halves.

## 0.1.57

- **Fixed: a column comment was indexed three times, and wide tables became
  magnets.** `_prose_text` fed the prose channel and `embed_text()` fed both
  the body channel and the vectors, so a table carrying a description per
  column matched on three of four channels for any question sharing a word
  with any one of its columns. Measured on Spider 2.0-lite, whose tables are
  documented that way: deleting every description *beat* keeping them, 13
  questions to 1 at top_k=10 (p=0.0018) -- which a design premised on prose
  helping should never lose. Column comments now stay out of the body and
  prose channels; `embed_text()` is untouched, so the vectors are
  byte-identical and no stored index is invalidated. The penalty is gone:
  the same paired comparison is now 2 to 2, p=1.000. Retrieval over all 247
  usable Spider 2.0 questions goes 66.8% to 71.7% at top_k=10, and nothing
  moves on the six shipped schemas, the live 1,200-object schema, or the
  token reduction.

- **Fixed: `benchmarks/spider2.py` was measuring a schemagate nobody runs.**
  It built its catalog with `add()` and `index()` instead of `bootstrap()`,
  so `collapse_partitions()` never ran and Spider 2.0's 92-day and 366-day
  table families were left as hundreds of near-identical objects competing
  for the same slots. Every Spider 2.0 number this project has published was
  measured that way. With it on -- which is what a real user gets -- recall
  over all 247 goes to 80.6% at top_k=10, and the gold SQL resolves for 233
  questions instead of 212. A measurement fix, not a retrieval one.

## 0.1.41

- **Added: the joins a schema implies but never declared.** Application
  schemas carry their relationships in column names and leave the constraints
  off -- migrations are faster without them and the ORM does the joining. On a
  real 1,245-object schema `contacts` declares `company_id -> companies` and
  `user_id -> users` but not `tenant_id`, though `tenants` is right there;
  across that schema 2,291 columns name an object that exists and are not
  declared as keys. Foreign-key expansion could only follow what was declared,
  so a question like "the contacts of xmagnet" was shown `contacts` alone and
  the model correctly answered that it could not resolve the name.

  Those edges are now read out of the data dictionary at reflection time,
  whatever the shop calls things: `customer_id`, `ID_CUSTOMER`, `member_key`,
  `fk_member`, against tables named `customers`, `CRM_CUSTOMER` or
  `dim_member`. An inferred edge is labelled as inferred in the DDL, because a
  model told a guess as fact writes a join the database does not enforce. A
  stem matching more than one table is left alone: a wrong join returns
  quietly incorrect rows, a missing one returns none.

  Measured on that schema: refusals across twenty runs fell from 35% to 25%,
  and "show the contacts of xmagnet" went from refusing five times out of five
  to answering five times out of five, with the same SQL each time.

- **Changed: a model that says INSUFFICIENT is asked again** (three times
  total) before that is reported. Nothing else is retried -- a reply that is
  not a SELECT, or contains a write, is raised at once, because re-rolling
  those would be asking a model repeatedly to get past a safety check.

- **Fixed: `temperature` is sent where it is accepted and dropped where it is
  not.** claude-sonnet-5 answers `400 ... temperature is deprecated for this
  model`; setting it blindly took the refusal rate from 35% to 100%.

## 0.1.40

- **Fixed: the OCI stack would not start.** `terraform init` failed on the
  Studio output added in 0.1.37 -- an output's `description` cannot
  interpolate a variable, and Terraform rejects it before reading anything
  else, so the whole downloaded stack refused to initialise. Verified now by
  running `terraform init` and `fmt -check` against the zip the release
  actually publishes, which is how this was caught.

## 0.1.39

- **Fixed: cataloguing made retrieval worse on a large schema.** Every
  description repeats the domain's words, so on 1,245 objects "contact" fell
  to idf 0.15 -- the word the user typed became the least informative token in
  the index -- while the table literally called `contacts` was pushed down by
  length normalisation for carrying 55 columns and a description. Measured:
  `contacts` ranked 3rd before cataloguing and below 40th after it. Scoring is
  now fielded -- name, body and written prose each with their own idf and
  length -- so a description cannot drown a name, and a weak catalogue can
  only ever make the prose channel useless instead of poisoning the rest.

- **Fixed: nothing was stemmed.** "how many claims" never matched "one row per
  claim". Every plural anyone types missed every singular a schema uses. The
  lexical layer stems both sides now; `tokenize` is untouched, because the
  embedder's vectors are a pinned guarantee.

- **Added: acronyms and compound words.** `v_pmpm` <- "per member per month",
  `myconvo` <- "my convo". Both filtered against the index vocabulary, so only
  forms the schema actually uses are added.

- **Added: coverage selection.** A question that needs a join names two things
  -- "campaigns ... and the tenant name" -- and ranking answered only the
  first; `tenants` was absent even at top_k=30. Each informative word the
  question used that no chosen object carries in its name now gets the best
  object that does, inside the same top_k budget.

- **Fixed: the object the user named outranks the ones that merely share a
  word with it**, and only the most specific match counts -- asking for
  `fact_claim_line_v2` also spells out `fact_claim_line`.

- **Fixed: backups and partitions outranked the tables they copy.**

Verified end to end on Oracle (a 4-join query over 30.8M rows), PostgreSQL
(1,245 objects), MySQL and SQLite.

## 0.1.37

- **Added: saved connections and saved models.** A Studio gets pointed at dev,
  then a replica, then a warehouse, and switching meant retyping a wallet
  directory and two passwords every time. Any number of each is now saved by
  name in `~/.schemagate/store.json` (0600), with a switcher in the header
  naming the database you are on and listing the rest one click away, and a
  tabbed Settings drawer -- Connections, Model, Who is asking, CLI -- with the
  saved lists on top. A saved model keeps its API key, so a restart no longer
  asks for it again.

- **Added: a schema browser.** Connecting to 1,245 objects used to show the
  word "connected" and an empty box. Every reflected object is now listed with
  its kind, column count and description, filterable, click to inspect --
  between the stat strip and the answer, capped and scrolling inside itself.

- **Fixed: retrieval found the wrong table on a large schema.** Three faults,
  each general:

  - A rare question word that appears in an object's *name* was under-weighted
    by rank fusion. `myconvo` occurs in 5 names out of 1,245, matched exactly,
    and its table still sat seventh behind six that merely said "campaign".
    Names now carry an IDF-weighted boost, stemmed so "positions" meets
    `position` and stopworded so "of" cannot hand it to
    `ref_chart_of_accounts`.
  - People write product names as they say them -- "my convo", "sign up".
    Identifiers write them as one token. Questions now also carry the joined
    form of adjacent pairs, filtered against the index vocabulary so `myconvo`
    survives and `whichmy` does not, on both the lexical and vector sides.
  - Backups and partitions out-ranked the tables they copy, carrying identical
    columns in a shorter document. `_bak`/`_bkp`/`_backup` are demoted even
    when the original is gone; `contacts_p0217` and `events_2026_07` are
    demoted when their parent is present.

  Measured on a live 1,245-object schema with no hints: "which my convo
  campaign worked the best" went from a refusal to an answer, "which users
  signed up in the last 30 days" from zero rows against `ai_reporter_users` to
  rows from `users`, "who are my top customers by total invoiced amount" from
  zero rows to fifty.

- **Added: a glossary, and hints that persist.** Two places for the words a
  schema cannot know. A hint is one object in your words; a glossary entry is
  one *word*, prepended to the cataloguing prompt so descriptions use your
  vocabulary and expanded into questions that mention it. Both stored per
  database, applied on every connect and resync.

- **Changed: a refusal gets one wider retry.** "The selected tables cannot
  answer this" nearly always means the right table was ninth and top_k was six.

- **Added: the Studio on the OCI stack.** On the instance's loopback, reached
  over the SSH you already have (`terraform output studio`). Not public: the
  Studio has no login, and anyone who could reach it could read the schema.

- **Docs: a Quick start** -- install, connect, catalogue, ask -- and what to do
  when a question picks the wrong table.

## 0.1.36

0.1.35 shipped only the first two entries below (row spacing, and the answer
kept in view). Everything else in this section was meant for it and landed
here.

- **Fixed: `postgres://` was rejected.** SQLAlchemy dropped that alias in
  1.4, but it is what Heroku, Render, Railway, Supabase and the RDS console
  hand out, and what ends up in a `DATABASE_URL`. Pasting it failed with
  `Can't load plugin: sqlalchemy.dialects:postgres`, which names a plugin and
  reads like a missing driver rather than one wrong word. Bare platform
  schemes are mapped to their SQLAlchemy dialect, driver included:
  `postgres`/`postgresql` -> `postgresql+psycopg`, `mysql` -> `mysql+pymysql`,
  `sqlserver`/`mssql` -> `mssql+pyodbc`, `oracle` -> `oracle+oracledb`. A
  URL that already names a driver is left alone.

- **Changed: a clear message for the legacy SQL Server ODBC driver.** The
  "SQL Server" driver that ships with Windows cannot bind the parameters the
  mssql dialect's reflection uses, and fails with `HY104 Invalid precision
  value (0)` against `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` -- which reads like a broken
  database. It now says it is the driver, and names the one to install.

- **Fixed: a remembered connection blocked startup.** Replaying it ran before
  the server started listening, so for the thirty seconds an Autonomous
  Database takes to reflect, the browser got a refused connection -- which
  looks like a Studio that failed to start. It replays on a background thread;
  the port answers in under a second and reports `connecting` meanwhile.

- **Added: Re-catalogue all, and Resync schema.** The first rewrites every
  description; the second re-reflects the database and keeps the descriptions
  you have, carrying them across by qualified name. Both were previously only
  reachable by reconnecting from scratch -- for a wallet, a directory and two
  passwords. Resync reports what it kept, restored and lost, and counts a
  description that came back from a database comment as kept, not lost.

- **Fixed: the demo's "Example AI descriptions" toggle showed on a live
  database.** It was hidden by the connect handler only, so a page loaded
  against a server already connected -- a replayed connection, or a refresh --
  showed a control announcing "no model is called on this page" over the
  user's own tables.

- **Changed: the model choice after connecting leads with the API key.** The
  local model was the primary button, sold as free with no mention that it
  downloads about 3 GB, runs on the CPU, and that a 1.5B model writes
  noticeably weaker descriptions. It is the second option and says so.

- **Changed: the rail says what is true about descriptions.** "Nothing is
  catalogued yet" over seven Oracle table comments now reads "7 already carry
  a description."

- **Docs: every subcommand and flag in the README**, plus the environment
  variables.

- **Fixed: a question that returned rows looked unanswered.** The Answer pane
  renders below the two result panes, and those panes size to their content --
  a 43-object Oracle catalog made each about 950px tall, so on a 1000px
  viewport the answer began at y=2315, over two screens down, with nothing to
  say it had arrived. The result panes are now capped and scroll internally,
  and the page brings the answer into view when it lands.

  The cap needed `min-height:0` on the panes to work at all: a grid item
  defaults to `min-height:auto`, so they ignored the container's max-height
  and grew to the full height of the DDL -- 1836px, taller than before, and
  overflowing far enough that the DDL painted over the cards beneath it.
  Measured after: panes 560px, the DDL scrolling inside them, page height
  2740px instead of 4178, and the answer sitting at the top of the viewport.

- **Fixed: every row of the working view sat flush against the next.** `.main`
  is a flex column with an 18px gap, and that gap is what spaces the page.
  `#workView` was introduced later as a wrapper around the working rows, which
  moved `.ask`, `.examples`, `.stats`, `.cost`, `.aiswitch` and `.results` one
  level down -- and a plain block wrapper carries no gap, so all of them lost
  their spacing at once. Measured before: the ask input ended at y=132 and the
  stat cards began at y=132, so their top borders touched the input's bottom
  border and read as part of its outline. The wrapper now carries the rhythm
  it interrupted, and the four rows are 18px apart at both desktop and phone
  width.

  The previous attempt at this shipped a rule scoped to `.main > :empty`,
  which matched nothing for the same reason: the rows it named are not
  children of `.main` any more. It is now scoped to both containers, so an
  empty row -- `#examples` is empty whenever a real database is connected,
  since the example questions belong to the demo -- collapses instead of
  taking a slot and doubling the gap above it to 36px.

## 0.1.34

- **Fixed: the Studio looked like it had lost a connection it still had.** The
  page was built once, when the server started, and those bytes were served to
  every request for the life of the process. Connecting updated the server but
  could not update the page, so refreshing the browser re-served the startup
  snapshot: a rail reading "Nothing connected yet" and an empty object list,
  while the header said "connected to your database" and `/api/settings`
  agreed. Nothing had been lost. The page is rendered per request now.

- **Added: `--remember`, and a "Remember this connection" checkbox.** The
  connection lived in the server process and nowhere else, so every Ctrl+C
  cost a wallet directory and two passwords. It can now be written to
  `~/.schemagate/connection.json` and replayed on the next start. What is
  stored is the connect request, not a resolved URL, because a URL cannot hold
  the wallet fields -- the case that hurts most to retype. Off unless asked
  for, since that file holds a database password; the file is opened `0600` at
  creation, an AI provider key is never included, and `--forget` deletes it.

- **Fixed: an idle pooled connection was handed out as though it were live.**
  Neither `create_engine` call set `pool_pre_ping`, so a connection an
  Autonomous Database had closed for being idle went to the next question and
  reported a database that was up as unreachable. Now `pool_pre_ping` with a
  30-minute recycle.

- **Changed: the AI catalog survives a small local model.** The prompt assumed
  a frontier one. A 1.5B instruct model returns "Sure! Here is the
  description:", or a markdown bullet, or the object name echoed as the
  subject, or -- most costly -- drops the everyday-words half that is the
  whole reason descriptions help business-phrased questions. None of those is
  an error; each is a string that gets stored, so the catalog looks complete
  while retrieval quietly gets worse. Two worked examples in the prompt, a
  repair pass, and one retry that says what was wrong with the last reply.
  The retry is on by default for `local:` providers and off for billed ones,
  where it would roughly double the cost of cataloguing a schema.

- **Fixed: everyday words that were just column names are dropped.** They are
  compared against the object's own identifier tokens, on the same
  tokenisation the ban list is built from -- otherwise `ord_id` slips past a
  set holding `ord` and `id` separately. Such a word adds nothing the column
  names did not already index, and crowds out one that would have helped.

- **Fixed: CI on Python 3.9.** Two tests imported `tomllib`, which is 3.11+,
  while the package supports 3.9. They assert things about pyproject's extras,
  which do not vary by interpreter, so they are skipped below 3.11.

## 0.1.33

- **Changed: connecting asks for the whole schema at once.** Reflection made
  four calls per table -- columns, primary key, foreign keys, comment. Against
  a local database that is invisible; against an Autonomous Database across a
  continent it is the entire cost of connecting, and it is what the page spent
  "Connecting..." doing. Measured on PostgreSQL with 65 objects: **332 queries
  before, 17 after**. At a 150ms round trip that is roughly 47 seconds of
  waiting removed from a 43-object connection.

  Oracle and PostgreSQL batch these natively. Dialects that do not are no
  worse off: SQLAlchemy loops internally, and every lookup still falls back to
  the single-table call.

- **Fixed: the paste-the-prompt controls stayed after a model had catalogued.**
  Revealed when no model is configured and never taken away, so a successful
  run left half the rail occupied by a prompt whose work was already done.

- **Changed: the restricted-objects list shows eight and offers the rest.**
  Taking visibility from the database's GRANTs marks every object an owner
  owns, so on Oracle that list is the whole schema and it pushed everything
  else off the rail.

818 tests.

## 0.1.32

- **Added: saving, connecting and cataloguing say so.** All three finished by
  changing a word in a panel you were no longer looking at -- and once the
  settings moved into a drawer, one you may have closed. Each now raises a
  confirmation that names what happened: which provider and model were saved
  and whether a key was stored, how many objects were connected and from
  which dialect, how many descriptions were written.

- **Added: cataloguing shows what it wrote.** It reported a count and
  displayed none of the result, so the only way to see whether the
  descriptions were any good was to ask a question that happened to select
  one. The first few now appear directly.

- **Fixed: "36 of 43" read as seven failures.** They are objects that already
  carry a database comment, which `describe(only_missing=True)` skips on
  purpose so you do not pay for them twice. The message says that now.

815 tests.

## 0.1.31

- **Fixed: a connected Studio insisting nothing was connected.** The page
  asked `/api/settings` once, at load, and believed the answer for the rest of
  its life. Anything that connected afterwards -- or any reload that raced the
  connection -- left it painting the disconnected state over a catalog it was
  simultaneously displaying: "no database connected" in the header, "Nothing is
  loaded yet" in the body, no Database panel, and 43 objects in the rail.

  `/api/settings` now returns the object count, and the page treats a catalog
  it can see as evidence of a connection rather than trusting a boolean it may
  have read too early.

812 tests.

## 0.1.30

- **Added: a wallet password that does not open the wallet is said so, before
  connecting.** This is the most expensive failure on this path because of how
  it surfaces. The driver reads the wallet, cannot decrypt `ewallet.pem`, and
  so never presents a client certificate. TLS completes anyway. The database,
  requiring mutual TLS, receives no certificate and hangs up. What comes back
  is `DPY-4011: the database or network closed the connection` -- which points
  at the network, and the network is fine. Hours go into firewalls, proxies
  and access control lists while the answer is a password.

  `ewallet.pem` is now decrypted before the connection is attempted, and a
  mismatch says what it is: every wallet download is sealed with the password
  typed into that dialog, it is not the database password, and it does not
  carry across downloads -- both files being called `Wallet_DBNAME.zip`.

812 tests.

## 0.1.29

- **Fixed: connecting and cataloguing both ended on a blank screen.** A
  catalog would load, 29 descriptions would be written, and the page showed
  two empty panes and four dashes with no sign that the next move was to type
  a question. It now says what those panes are for, puts the cursor in the
  question box, and the cataloguing message ends with "Now ask a question
  above."

- **Fixed: `Failed to execute 'insertBefore' on 'Node'` when returning the
  connect form to the rail.** The form was put back "before the element that
  used to follow it" -- which was the recipe panel, which the settings drawer
  had since moved out of the rail, so the rail was asked to insert before a
  node that was no longer its child. It now leaves an anchor of its own in
  place, and falls back to appending rather than throwing.

804 tests.

## 0.1.28

- **Changed: a blocked port says it is a blocked port.** `DPY-6005` and
  `DPY-4011` on an Oracle connection both mean the TCP connection never
  happened, and on an Autonomous Database that is nearly always a network that
  will not carry 1522 -- a wallet fault reads `ORA-28759` or a PEM error, and
  arrives before any network attempt. The message now says so, and points at
  the ORDS connection type, because the machine that cannot reach 1522 can
  almost always reach Database Actions on 443.

804 tests.

## 0.1.27

- **Added: Oracle over HTTPS (ORDS) -- an Autonomous Database with no wallet
  and nothing on port 1522.** SQL*Net wants 1522 and a great many corporate
  networks do not give it one. The same machine loads Database Actions in a
  browser without trouble, because that is 443. So the catalog can be read
  that way instead: `schemagate.ords.reflect_ords()` runs the `USER_*` catalog
  queries through the ORDS SQL endpoint in a single request and returns the
  same `ObjectDoc` list reflection produces over the driver. In the Studio it
  is a connection type -- paste the Database Actions link, a user and a
  password.

  Verified against a live Autonomous Database, not a fixture: 29 objects, 161
  columns and 30 foreign keys in 3.3 seconds, with selection returning 8 of 29
  at 657 prompt tokens against 2,397 for the whole schema.

  What it does not do, and says so: no rows. No sampled values, no GRANT
  reading, and the model's SQL cannot be run, because all three need a
  connection this path does not have. Nothing new to install -- it is
  `urllib`.

- **Fixed: `connected` meant "has an engine", which the ORDS path never has.**
  The catalog would load, 29 real tables would appear, and the page would
  insist it still needed connecting and pull the connect form back over them.
  It now means a database has been reflected; whether SQL can be run is a
  separate answer (`can_run_sql`).

- **Fixed: the Oracle proxy is opt-in again.** 0.1.26 adopted a generic
  `HTTPS_PROXY`, which a corporate machine sets for web traffic. Quietly
  tunnelling SQL*Net through an HTTP proxy that will not carry it turned a
  plain "timed out" into `DPY-4011: the database or network closed the
  connection` -- a worse error, further from the truth, that blames the
  database for a firewall. Only `SCHEMAGATE_ORACLE_PROXY` is read now.

804 tests.

## 0.1.26

- **Fixed: the reason for a failed connection is on the second line, and was
  being thrown away.** oracledb reports `DPY-6005: cannot connect to database`
  and then, on the next line, why -- `timed out` or `[Errno 111] Connection
  refused`. Those are different problems: a firewall swallowing packets versus
  nothing listening. 0.1.20 kept the first line only, so both arrived as the
  same sentence -- the exact collapsing that release existed to undo. Up to
  three lines now survive, `Help:` URLs are dropped, and the whole thing stays
  bounded so a traceback cannot drag a connect string along behind it.

- **Added: Oracle connections can tunnel through an HTTPS proxy.** A network
  that blocks 1522 outbound usually still permits a proxy, and oracledb can
  connect through one. Set `SCHEMAGATE_ORACLE_PROXY=host:port` (or rely on
  `HTTPS_PROXY`, which a machine behind a corporate network already has) and
  it is passed as `https_proxy`/`https_proxy_port`. A proxy you pass
  explicitly is never overridden, and it is applied to Oracle only -- psycopg
  rejects the keyword.

787 tests.

## 0.1.25

- **Changed: identity, model and the command-line recipe moved into Settings.**
  They are configuration -- set once, then in the way -- and they were taking
  up most of a rail that sits beside every question you ask. A gear in the
  header opens a drawer; Escape or the backdrop closes it. The panels are
  moved into it rather than copied, so there is still one `#principal` field
  and one set of handlers.

  What is left on the working screen is the schema, the catalog, the
  restrictions in force and the hints -- the things that describe what you are
  looking at, not what you configured.

783 tests.

## 0.1.24

- **Added: the page hands you the code for what you just did.** The Studio is
  a test bench; the library is the product, and the code block was an
  illustration containing someone else's database, someone else's question and
  someone else's identity -- the right shape, rewritten line by line before it
  could run. It is now this connection, this question, this principal and
  these roles, and it runs as pasted. Verified by pasting it: the block the
  page produced was executed unmodified and printed the DDL.

- **Added: a mark and a favicon.** Three rows arrive, a gate, one leaves --
  which is the product. The favicon is a data URI so a self-contained page
  carries its own icon, and the header mark is drawn in `currentColor` so it
  follows the theme rather than needing a second definition for dark mode.

780 tests.

## 0.1.23

- **Removed: the box for pasting your own SQL, and `/api/run-sql` with it.**
  This page decides which tables reach a model. Text you typed yourself does
  not participate in that decision -- it goes straight past selection, past
  the identity, past the restrictions -- so the panel demonstrated nothing the
  product does, while being the only surface here that executed arbitrary
  input. Every database already ships a SQL client.

  The model still writes SQL and still runs it: that path goes through
  `/api/answer`, where the statement is generated from the selected tables and
  checked before it reaches the database. That is the one worth having,
  because it is the one the selection actually shapes.

778 tests.

## 0.1.22

- **Changed: connecting is the page, until there is a connection.** The one
  thing the Studio needs from you was the third panel in a nine-panel rail,
  sized like a footnote, beside a working view that had nothing in it. With
  nothing connected, the connect form now moves to the middle of the page
  under a plain heading and everything else steps back. It is the same
  `<section>` in both places -- moved, not duplicated -- so its fields and
  handlers survive the trip, and it goes back to the rail once there is a
  database to talk to.

- **Added: the cataloguing question is asked once, at the moment it has an
  answer.** The instant a connection lands: "29 objects reflected from oracle.
  Nothing is described yet." -- and three ways forward. Not now, a local model
  that is free and needs no key, or an API key. Asked from a rail panel this
  reads as configuration, and nobody configures a thing they have not seen
  work yet.

- **Added: picking a provider fills in a model id.** Choosing the local
  provider left an empty box whose answer -- `Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct` --
  was written down only in a docstring. Each provider now supplies a working
  default, switching replaces a default with the new one's, and a model id you
  typed yourself survives the switch. The API key box is hidden for the local
  provider, which has no use for one.

786 tests.

## 0.1.21

- **Fixed: connecting is bounded.** A host that drops packets rather than
  refusing them -- which is exactly what a firewall in front of port 1522
  looks like -- never returned. The page sat on "Connecting..." indefinitely
  with nothing to report. Each driver's connect timeout is now set (20s), and
  oracledb's retries capped, so that silence becomes `DPY-6005: cannot connect
  to database`. Measured against a black-hole address: 20 seconds, then an
  error naming the failure.

- **Changed: connecting reflects and gets out of the way.** Reading values is
  the only part that touches rows and the only part whose cost is set by the
  network rather than by the schema, so inside a connect it now gets a 10
  second leash rather than the library's 30. Whatever was sampled is kept.
  Cataloguing with a model happens afterwards, on demand -- that is where the
  minutes belong.

- **Fixed: a short password no longer corrupts the error it appears in.**
  Masking by substring meant a one-character password rewrote every occurrence
  of that letter: `oracledb.exceptions` came back as `oracledb.exce***tions`.
  Secrets under four characters are left alone -- a fragment that short was
  never recoverable from the message anyway, and destroying the diagnosis to
  hide it protected nothing.

782 tests.

## 0.1.20

- **Fixed: a failed connection now says what failed.** Driver messages quote
  the connect string they were handed, and a connect string carries a
  password, so the whole message was dropped and only the exception class
  shown. What reached the user was "OperationalError" -- the same word for a
  blocked port, a wrong password, and an alias that does not resolve. Three
  problems with nothing in common except that you cannot tell which one you
  have.

  The driver's code is the diagnosis and is not a secret. `DPY-6005` is
  "cannot connect", `ORA-01017` is a bad password, `ORA-12154` is an alias
  that did not resolve. The Studio now reports the code and the message with
  every secret from that request masked out of it, the SQLAlchemy class
  prefix stripped, and the code hoisted to the front so it survives the width
  of a form field.

  Verified against a live failure rather than a constructed one: an
  unreachable Oracle now reads `could not connect -- DPY-6005: cannot connect
  to database`, and a PostgreSQL URL carrying a password returns the refusal
  without the password in it.

780 tests.

## 0.1.19

- **Fixed: reading sample values no longer runs without a time limit.**
  `--values`, and the "Read values of short, non-personal columns" box in the
  Studio, cost one query per candidate column. On a local database that is
  nothing. Against an Autonomous Database over a wallet it is a round trip
  each, and a schema of ordinary width sat behind "Connecting..." for long
  enough to look hung, with no way to tell a slow link from a hang.

  Sampling now stops at a wall clock -- `sample_budget`, 30 seconds by default,
  `0` for no limit. Past it, reflection keeps whatever was sampled and finishes
  normally: values are an enrichment, and a catalog missing some of them beats
  a connect that never returns.

  Measured against a real PostgreSQL 16 rather than SQLite: five objects and
  seven sampled columns in 0.07s normally, and with the budget exhausted, the
  same five objects in 0.04s with sampling skipped.

- **Fixed: a wrong TNS alias fails immediately instead of after a timeout.**
  An alias that is not in the wallet's `tnsnames.ora` cannot resolve, but the
  driver does not say so quickly -- it reports a connection failure after its
  own timeout, which looks exactly like a slow network. The alias is now
  checked against the wallet first, and the error lists the aliases the wallet
  actually has. Asking for a wallet with no alias at all lists them too.

767 tests.

## 0.1.18

- **Fixed: `schemagate studio` no longer opens on someone else's tables.**
  A bare Studio loaded the bundled 42-object sample, and the header said
  "connected to your database" over it -- the string was written in once for
  any page served by the backend, without asking whether a database was
  connected. So the command you run to point the tool at your own data
  answered with invented tables, labelled as yours. The only clue was
  recognising that `sales_order` was not a table you had.

  Now nothing loads unless it was asked for. `schemagate studio` opens on an
  empty **Your database** tab with the Connect panel and instructions, and the
  header follows the server's answer: "no database connected", "demo schema --
  not your data", or "connected to your database".

- **Added: the demo is a second tab rather than a replacement.** The live
  catalog used to overwrite the bundled one, which left a Studio with nothing
  connected showing only the sample and no way back to it afterwards. There
  are two tabs now: **Your database**, which talks to this process, and
  **Demo schema**, which runs the same in-browser sample the public page does.
  Selection is routed per tab -- the demo never asks the backend about its
  tables, which would either error or, worse, match something real in the
  database you are connected to.

  The panels that talk to the server -- Connect, Run SQL, model, AI catalog --
  appear only on the live tab. "Run SQL" on the demo tab would have run
  against the live engine while the screen showed invented tables.

- **Added: `schemagate studio --demo`** opens on the sample schema for anyone
  who wants a look before connecting anything.

761 tests.

## 0.1.17

- **Changed: `schemagate studio` connects to databases without a flag.**
  `--allow-connect` was making every local user ask permission for the feature
  the page exists to provide. On loopback there is nobody to ask: the only
  person who can reach the page is already at a shell on this machine, and
  they can open a database without the Studio's help.

  The risk the flag guards is real everywhere else -- a Studio on `0.0.0.0` is
  a URL box anyone on the network can use to make this server connect to hosts
  only it can see -- so the default follows the bind address. On
  `127.0.0.1`, `localhost` or `::1` the Connect panel is there. On any other
  address it takes `--allow-connect`, and `--no-connect` turns it off
  anywhere.

  So the whole thing is now two commands:

      pip install "schemagate[all,oci]"
      schemagate

- **Documented: `pip install "schemagate[all,oci]"`.** The OCI SDK is what
  lets cataloguing run through OCI Generative AI with no API key. It is not in
  `[all]` on a measurement rather than a preference: 488 MB and 17,505 modules
  on its own, against 217 MB for every database driver, every model SDK and
  MCP combined.

750 tests.

## 0.1.16

- **Fixed: connecting to a database left the demo on screen.** The page is
  built around the bundled schema, and its hints, its restricted object and
  its example questions are baked in. After connecting they stayed -- so the
  header read "connected to your database" while the rail still said
  `hr_compensation needs payroll`, about a database with no such table. Not a
  cosmetic problem: the page was stating an access rule that did not exist, in
  the one panel someone would check to find out what the access rules are.

  Connecting now replaces the rail with the live catalog's own -- empty, for a
  database nobody has catalogued yet -- clears the question box and the last
  result, and hides the two pieces that only ever applied to the demo: the
  "running entirely in this browser tab" intro, and the pre-written AI
  descriptions toggle.

  Cataloguing follows the connection, which is the half worth testing rather
  than assuming: the describe prompt now names the tables of the database that
  was connected, and none of the demo's.

- **Added: the command that reproduces the connection.** Connecting in a page
  is how someone tries this; a command is how they use it. After a successful
  connect the Studio shows the `schemagate select ... --url ...` line and the
  Python equivalent, carrying the same schemas and flags that were actually
  used -- otherwise it would be a different, quieter connection that happens
  to reach the same database.

  Passwords are placeholders, and the placeholder is `$DB_PASSWORD` rather
  than `***` because the point is a command someone can paste and run. A
  command with a live password in it ends up in a screenshot, a chat message
  and shell history, which are the three places a password is hardest to
  recall from. A wallet connection carries its `SCHEMAGATE_CONNECT_ARGS`,
  since a wallet is not a URL and a command with only `--url` in it would
  connect to nothing.

  Everything stays on the machine that runs it: the server is local, the page
  is local, and nothing is written to disk.

- **Documented: `pip install "schemagate[all,oci]"`.** The OCI SDK is what
  lets cataloguing run through OCI Generative AI with no API key -- the
  instance principal path the Resource Manager stack uses. It is not in
  `[all]` and the reason is a measurement rather than a preference: on its own
  it is 488 MB and 17,505 Python modules, against 217 MB for every database
  driver, every model SDK and MCP combined. Folding it in would make the
  default install eight times heavier for a service most users never call, so
  it stays one word away.

743 tests.

## 0.1.15

Two things 0.1.14 got wrong the moment someone read it.

- **Renamed: `--allow-connect`.** It shipped as `--allow-remote-connect`,
  which reads as "let someone control this machine remotely". It does not do
  that -- it lets the Connect panel hand the server a database URL, and the
  server opens it. A flag guarding a real risk has to describe the real risk,
  or people turn it on to find out what it does. The old spelling still works
  and always will; it is in a published release.

- **Added: `pip install "schemagate[all]"`.** Choosing the extra that matches
  your database is a step nobody should have to take to try something. One
  command now brings every driver, the model SDKs and MCP; `[databases]` is
  the four drivers alone.

  Not the default, and that is deliberate rather than cautious: the base
  install is one dependency, so `import schemagate` cannot fail over a driver
  nobody is using -- there is a test that fails if the core import ever grows
  another. `[all]` also leaves out `huggingface` (a torch download) and `oci`
  (thousands of modules), which are large enough that someone should ask for
  them by name.

734 tests.

## 0.1.14

Connect to a database from the Studio, plus a Windows bug that made the Studio unquittable, a leak in `--values`, and two
things in the repo that were quietly lying.

- **Added: connect from the page.** `POST /api/connect` reflects a database
  into the running Studio, optionally taking visibility from its GRANTs and
  reading column values; `POST /api/run-sql` runs one read-only statement
  through the same guard as `--sql`. A Connect panel and a Run SQL box drive
  both, so pointing Studio at a database no longer means restarting it with a
  different `--url`.

  Connecting is **off** unless the server was started with
  `--allow-remote-connect`. It is the one thing on the page that reaches
  outside the process: with it on, anyone who can reach the Studio can make
  the server connect anywhere it can see, using whatever credentials they
  type. A failed connection reports only the exception type, because driver
  errors quote the URL they were handed and a URL carries a password -- and
  the page clears the URL box on success for the same reason.

  `schemagate studio` also takes `--restrict-from-grants` and `--values`.

- **Added: `schemagate.connect`.** The Connect box asked for a SQLAlchemy URL
  and most people do not have one -- an Oracle team has a wallet zip and a TNS
  alias, a SQL Server team has a JDBC string from a config file.
  `resolve(spec)` returns `(url, connect_args)` from any of: a SQLAlchemy URL,
  a JDBC URL for PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, MySQL or SQLite, an Oracle
  wallet (directory or the zip as downloaded), or host/port/database fields.
  The Studio picks the kind from a dropdown and shows only the fields that
  kind needs.

  Oracle's service-name form is the one that needed care: JDBC writes
  `@//host:port/service` and SQLAlchemy wants `?service_name=`. The obvious
  translation treats the last segment as a SID, which connects to nothing and
  reports a login failure -- so the symptom points at the password rather than
  at the URL.

  A wallet zip is extracted next to itself, not into a temporary directory:
  the driver re-reads `sqlnet.ora` and the wallet on every reconnect, so a
  directory that vanishes gives a connection that works exactly once. Both the
  flat layout the OCI console ships and a re-zipped one with a folder inside
  are handled, and a zip that writes outside its own directory is refused.

- **Fixed: Ctrl+C did not stop the Studio on Windows.** `main()` waited with
  `threading.Event().wait(3600)`. Python runs a signal handler only between
  bytecodes in the main thread, and Windows has no EINTR to cut a wait short,
  so Ctrl+C sat unhandled for up to an hour and the only way out was killing
  python.exe. On Linux and macOS the wait is interrupted immediately, which is
  why it survived: it was never broken on the machines it was written on. It
  now waits in short slices and closes the listening socket on the way out, so
  an immediate restart does not fail with "address already in use".

- **Fixed: `--values` sent personal data to the model.** It put real row
  values in the prompt with no guard beyond string type, width and distinct
  count. On a live PostgreSQL that meant names and home addresses going to
  whichever provider was configured:

      hr.employee full_name    -> ['A Patel', 'B Osei']
      hr.employee home_address -> ['12 Main St', '9 Kings Rd']

  Three guards. A column already restricted with `restrict_column` is never
  sampled, and restricting one now clears anything sampled earlier. Column
  names that read as personal -- name, address, email, phone, ssn, dob, birth,
  passport -- are skipped by default, and the list is overridable because a
  deny-list is wrong by construction: it misses `nachname`, `nino`, `mrn`. And
  a column must have distinct values well under the row count, so a two-row
  table never qualifies -- three distinct values in a three-row table says
  only that the table is small.

  The guards are a floor, not a boundary. What actually protects a column is
  `restrict_column`, which is exact, and the fact that `--values` is off by
  default.

- **Fixed: a value list looked unfinished.** Rendered into a column list, the
  DDL's own comma landed after the comment -- `one of: 'Acme', 'Globex',` reads
  as a list that continues. The comma belongs to the declaration, so it goes
  before the note. Every comment had the problem; value lists are where it
  showed.

- **Fixed: `studio/build.py` destroyed the Studio.** The template had fallen
  behind the shipped page -- no `mKey`, no `answerPane`, no `catPrompt` -- so
  running the documented build command silently deleted the entire model panel
  and took 25 tests with it. Nothing warned, because a string substitution
  succeeds whether or not the template still has the panel. The template is
  regenerated from the shipped page, the build now reproduces it byte for
  byte, and a test fails if the two ever disagree again.

- **Fixed: `schemagate certify` was a dead command.** It looked for
  `scripts/certify_dialect.py` three directories above the installed module --
  a path that exists in a git checkout and nowhere else. Every pip user got a
  link to GitHub instead of a certification run, and the comment explaining
  the fallback said the script was in the sdist, which it was not. The
  implementation moved into the package; `scripts/certify_dialect.py` still
  works and now calls it.

732 tests. Guards, render, Connect and Run SQL all verified against a
live PostgreSQL 16 -- Connect driven through the browser DOM: 219 objects
reflected, 218 restricted by GRANTs, a nested role expanded, four rows back
from a SELECT and a DROP refused.

## 0.1.13

Two things promised in public and not shipped for twelve releases, a live bug,
and the objection that ends evaluations.

- **Added: column-level restriction.** `Catalog.restrict_column(table, column,
  roles)`. The object-level rule could not express the common case -- the table
  is the right answer and one column in it is not. A restricted column is
  **absent** from the DDL, not masked: `ssn REDACTED` tells a model the table
  holds one, and a model that knows a column exists can ask about it, join on
  it, or mention it in an explanation. Any `-- FK` line naming a withheld
  column is dropped too, since it would put the identifier straight back.

  Object and column visibility now go through one function, `models.allowed`.
  Two copies of a visibility rule drift, and a drifted ACL is the failure this
  library exists to prevent.

- **Added: `Selection.to_dict()`.** The record an auditor asks for afterwards
  and the one thing that cannot be reconstructed later -- the catalog will
  have changed, the roles will have changed, and the question is gone. It
  carries the count of withheld columns, never their names: a log that lists
  what it withheld has disclosed it to everyone who can read the log.

- **Fixed: `--values` did nothing for TEXT columns.** `_candidates` skipped
  unbounded TEXT as "assume prose", which silently disabled the feature for
  every string column in SQLite, where type affinity declares almost
  everything TEXT, and for the many PostgreSQL schemas that use `text` by
  convention rather than `varchar(n)`. Those users got nothing and no
  indication why. Unbounded columns are now sampled and judged on the data
  that comes back rather than the width that was declared.

- **Added: `--restrict-from-grants`** and `schemagate.grants`. At forty tables
  a hand-written restrict map is fine; at four hundred it is a second copy of
  an ACL that already exists in the database, and two copies drift. Reads
  PostgreSQL and Oracle, flattens nested roles transitively, and leaves an
  object with no grant row untouched -- silence is not a denial, and
  restricting on absence would break a working catalog the first time a
  connection could not see everything.

  Two bugs in that SQL were found only by running it against live servers,
  which is why it was not shipped until they had. `pg_get_userbyid(0)` renders
  PUBLIC as `unknown (OID=0)`, so the PUBLIC rule never fired and every
  world-readable table came back restricted to a role nobody holds. And the
  role graph was inverted: it expanded upward to parent roles instead of
  downward to the roles that inherit the granted one, handing an object
  granted to a narrow role to every broader role above it. An over-grant is
  the direction that leaks rather than annoys.

- **Fixed:** `Scored.reason` documented `vector | lexical | fk | pinned` while
  `hybrid` was also emitted -- a value the type said could not occur.

- **Docs:** the README now opens with a command that returns rows rather than
  a list of table names, and the identity claim is two commands with no
  database. `CONTRIBUTING.md` records the rules the tests enforce, including
  that vendor SQL is not tested until an instance has run it.

657 tests, no warnings, ruff and mypy clean across 30 source files. Grant
readers verified against live PostgreSQL 16 and Oracle 26ai.

## 0.1.12

The version that stops needing a terminal, and the one where a model can help
pick the tables rather than only write the SQL.

- **Added: Studio does the whole job now.** It used to take a question and
  show you tables. It now has a model panel (provider, model, key, and
  switches for ranking and answering), an AI catalog panel, and an answer
  panel that shows the SQL and the rows. `schemagate` with no arguments opens
  it. The key is a password field, held in memory for the life of the
  process, never written to disk, and never returned by the API -- so a
  screenshot of Studio does not leak it. A blank key field means "keep the
  one you have", because making someone retype a key to flip a checkbox is
  the friction that ends with keys in shell history.

- **Added: `--rerank`, and the same switch in Studio.** Matching identifiers
  has a ceiling this project has always published: recall@6 is 100% across
  five test schemas and 50% on the one where questions use business words
  rather than table words. Nothing fixes that row by weighting, because
  "doctors" and `provider` share no characters. So the maths narrows hundreds
  of objects to twenty for free, and a model orders those twenty. One small
  call over one-line summaries -- no DDL in the prompt.

  It cannot widen access: the model is handed the list `select()` already
  filtered by principal, so a restricted table is not in the prompt to
  promote. And it cannot make things worse: a provider that raises, times out
  or answers with prose leaves the maths order untouched.

- **Added: cataloguing from the browser, with or without a key.** With a
  model it catalogues in place; without one it hands over the prompt and
  takes the JSON reply back, code fences and all. This is the step that
  raises accuracy most and the one people skip, and until now skipping it was
  the only option in the UI.

- **Fixed: `hidden` did not hide.** It loses to any element carrying an
  explicit display, and both `.pane` and `section` set one, so the answer
  panel sat on the page, empty, whether or not answering was switched on.
  Found by driving the real page in a browser rather than trusting the
  markup.

- **Fixed: parsing a model's reply mistook table names for choices.** A plain
  `\d+` reads `main.t3` as the number 3 and `tbl_183` as 183. The schema this
  was measured against has 180 tables named `stg_feed_007` and
  `audit_event_042`, so every one of them was a live mis-parse. Caught by
  writing the test from a real reply shape before it ever reached a paid
  model.

- **Cleaned:** fourteen unused imports, sixteen type errors, and a warning
  the suite emitted at itself on every run. None broke anything, which is why
  they survived -- but a run with a warning in it trains you to skip reading
  the output, and that is how a real one gets missed.

618 tests, no warnings, ruff and mypy clean across all 29 source files.
Verified live on Oracle 26ai and PostgreSQL 16 running the same 219-object
schema, and through the browser DOM: ask as an analyst, get `billing_payment`;
add the payroll role and one pasted description, and the pay table is first.

## 0.1.11

**Install this rather than 0.1.10 if you use Oracle.** 0.1.10 shipped a
regression that makes reflection hang on a large Oracle database. It was
found by a live apply against an Autonomous Database, where the endpoint
never came up.

- **Fixed: Oracle reflection scanned the whole data dictionary.** 0.1.10
  replaced a per-table type lookup with a single per-database one and dropped
  the `owner = :o` predicate in the process. That predicate is what makes it
  an indexed lookup; without it `all_tab_columns` is a scan across every
  schema the caller can see. Against a local Oracle with 219 objects the
  difference is invisible, which is why it shipped. Against an Autonomous
  Database exposing ~1,500 objects it is not, and it runs during reflection,
  which on the OCI stack happens at boot -- so the MCP endpoint simply never
  opened. It is now scoped per owner: bounded and indexed like the per-table
  query, asked once per schema like the per-database one. One schema of 219
  objects is still one query; ten schemas is ten, not two thousand.

- **Added: `--values`.** A model was handed `status VARCHAR(30)` and wrote
  `WHERE status = 'DENIED'`. The rows say `denied`. The SQL was correct in
  every way a schema can express and returned nothing, which reads as "there
  are no denied claims" rather than as a mistake -- the worst shape of wrong
  answer available. Nothing the model was given could have told it the casing
  of a value it had never seen. Reflection can now read the distinct values of
  short string columns that hold only a handful, and render them as
  `status VARCHAR(30)  -- one of: 'denied', 'paid'`.

  Off by default. Everything else in this library reads metadata; this reads
  rows, which is a different promise about someone's database. Candidates are
  chosen by declared width rather than by names like "status" or "type",
  because the interesting column on someone else's schema is called something
  this code has never heard of. Wide columns are never queried, primary keys
  are skipped, and a column with more distinct values than the cap costs one
  small query and is then dropped.

- **Changed: the stack pins the version it installs.** cloud-init installed
  `schemagate` unpinned, so a release published after someone downloaded the
  stack changed what booted on it. It now installs the version the zip was cut
  with, settable in the console form, with `""` still meaning newest. If the
  pin is not on PyPI yet it says so and installs the newest rather than
  leaving a machine with no schemagate and nothing explaining why.

- **Added:** `oci/stack/verify-release.sh`, one command that checks PyPI has
  the release before applying anything, runs the stack's own 6/6, and then
  checks what 6/6 does not -- the library that was installed on the instance.
  And `examples/oracle_local.py`, which starts Oracle in Docker, builds a
  219-object schema with rows in it, and answers questions, so trying this
  against Oracle does not start with three setup problems.

Verified on live Oracle 26ai and PostgreSQL 16 running the same 219-object
schema: one indexed catalog query, the same four denied claims from both, the
same table withheld from a caller without the role, and the same UPDATE
refused. 562 tests pass.

## 0.1.10

Mostly library. The reflection the server does once it is up changed on both
engines; the stack's behaviour did not, but its files did, and that is worth
stating precisely rather than waving at.

After 0.1.9 was tagged, `main.tf` was split into per-concern files
(`network.tf`, `database.tf`, `compute.tf`, ...) to match the layout Oracle's
quickstart templates use. Comparing the 0.1.9 tag against this release block
by block: 37 blocks then, 37 now, none added, none dropped, and every body
identical once comments and whitespace are normalised — except one `output`
description, reworded. So it is a pure reorganisation, and `terraform
validate` passes, `fmt` is clean, the zip still has its `.tf` at the root, and
`adb_version` still accepts 19c and 26ai while rejecting 23ai and 21c.

What that does *not* prove: the split has never been through a live apply.
0.1.9's `6/6 CERTIFIED` run was against the single-file version. The
reorganisation is as safe as static checking can make it, and it is still
untested against a running Autonomous Database.

Everything below was found by running against a real database. The unit tests
passed throughout; none of these were visible without one.

- **Fixed: a cached engine could hand a later engine the wrong database's
  column types.** The per-engine type cache was keyed on `id(engine)`, and
  CPython reuses the id of a collected object — so an engine opened after an
  earlier one was garbage collected could match that key and be served the
  previous database's types without issuing a query. Reproduced: a fresh
  engine whose column was `integer` came back `geometry(Point,4326)`. The
  cache is now keyed weakly on the engine itself, which also stops it growing
  without bound in a long-lived process.

- **Fixed: PostgreSQL extension tables inside `public` were catalogued as
  user data.** Excluding whole schemas is not enough when the extension is
  installed into `public`, which is the default. `spatial_ref_sys` alone is
  8,500 rows of map projections. A dialect can now name individual objects,
  not just schemas; PostGIS noise drops to zero.

- **Fixed: PostGIS's `topology` schema was missed.** An extension's schema is
  recorded on `pg_extension.extnamespace`; `pg_depend` alone only finds a
  schema the extension's script created separately. Both are read now.

- **Fixed: PostgreSQL enums, domains, geometry and geography reached the
  prompt as `NULL` or `VARCHAR(n)`.** The catalog query contained
  `LIKE 'pg_toast%'`, and psycopg3 reads `%` as a placeholder — the query
  raised and every type fill silently reverted. The query now contains no
  percent sign. `feeling` reads `mood ENUM('sad', 'ok', 'happy')` and `qty`
  reads `positive_int DOMAIN OVER integer`, which is what a model needs to
  write a correct `WHERE`.

- **Fixed: silent failure.** `unknown_types` wrapped its own work in
  `try/except Exception`, so the bug above looked like "no types to fill"
  rather than an error. The registry already guards a database that will not
  answer; the inner catch only hid programming errors, and had been hiding a
  `NameError` on every call. Removed.

- **Changed: Oracle asks for column types once per engine, not once per
  table.** Previously every table with an unrecognised column cost its own
  round trip to the Autonomous Database for an answer that is identical every
  time. Scoped by the same `ORACLE_MAINTAINED` signal the schema filter
  already uses, so it reads no catalog view this module was not already
  reading.

- **Added: `--answer`.** Selecting six tables and stopping there is half a
  pipeline. `--answer` writes the SQL from those six and runs it. The model
  stays yours: with no `--provider` it prints a prompt to paste into any chat
  and calls nobody, `--sql` runs what you paste back, and a provider is used
  only when you name one, with your own key. There is no default model id.
  Every run says which provider and model wrote the SQL, which matters under
  `--provider auto` -- that picks by whichever key is in the environment, and
  you should not have to guess which service received your schema.
  Generated SQL is refused unless it is a single SELECT or WITH, including
  when a second statement is hidden after a `--` or `/* */` comment.

- **Fixed: `describe --provider none` exited asking for a `--model`** it would
  never use -- so the one documented path for people without an API key was
  the one that did not work.

- **Changed: the stack pins the version it installs.** cloud-init installed
  `schemagate` unpinned, so a release published after someone downloaded the
  stack changed what booted on it -- a stack that worked last month failing
  with nothing in the zip to explain why. It now installs the version the zip
  was cut with, settable in the console form, and `""` still means newest. If
  the pin is not on PyPI yet it says so and installs the newest rather than
  leaving a machine with no schemagate and no explanation.

Measured on PostgreSQL 16 with PostGIS, 405 objects across 10 schemas: one
catalog query for the whole reflection (not 405), 2.8 s to bootstrap, 16 ms
median selection, and a 1,037-character prompt covering 6 of 405 objects.

Then verified again on the same 219-object hospital schema built twice, once
on Oracle 26ai and once on PostgreSQL 16, with the same commands against
both: the same four denied claims came back, the same table was withheld from
a caller without the role, and the same UPDATE was refused. The two engines
share nothing but SQLAlchemy and did not diverge.

## 0.1.9

Stack only — no library change.

**Certified unattended.** A run went from apply to a serving MCP endpoint with
nothing typed in between — the port answered 150 seconds after the apply
returned, cataloguing succeeded on its first attempt, and `verify.sh` reached
`6/6 CERTIFIED` and destroyed everything by itself. 0.1.8 got to 6/6 but needed
one manual `systemctl kill` to clear a deadlock; that is the caveat this
release removes.

- **Fixed: the two boot units deadlocked each other.** `resolve-db` wrote the
  connection descriptor and then blocked on `systemctl restart schemagate`.
  The server is ordered `After=` that unit, so systemd would not start it until
  resolve-db finished — and resolve-db could not finish until the restart
  returned. Each waited for the other and the port never opened. Both in-unit
  restarts are `--no-block` now, which queues the job and returns. The endpoint
  went from never answering to answering in 150 seconds.
- **`23ai` is no longer an accepted `adb_version`.** It stops being valid in
  December 2026, and a stack that still offered it would begin failing then
  rather than at a time the operator chose. `19c` remains the default — it is
  the version this stack has actually applied with, four times — and `26ai` is
  selectable for anyone who wants it, available in every commercial region
  except Bogota (BOG), Riyadh (RUH) and Singapore West (XSP). Making 26ai the
  default was tried and pulled: no apply with it set was seen through to
  completion, and a default that has never finished an apply is not a default.
- **PyPI is linked from the stack, which it never was.** The stack README and
  the Resource Manager form both say the instance installs the library from
  <https://pypi.org/project/schemagate/>, and that anyone with a database
  already can skip all of this with `pip install schemagate`. A new `next_step`
  output says the same thing at the end of an apply, where someone who just
  deployed will actually read it.
- `terraform fmt` applied — it had drifted on `main.tf` and `variables.tf` —
  and `terraform validate` passes.
- The README's caveat is narrowed rather than dropped: `verify.sh` reached
  `6/6 CERTIFIED`, and the one remaining gap is that no run has yet gone from
  apply to serving endpoint without the single manual `systemctl kill` that
  cleared the deadlock. The `--no-block` fix for it ships here.

## 0.1.8

Stack only — no library change.

**Certified on a live tenancy.** `verify.sh` ran to `6/6 CERTIFIED` — plan,
apply, the MCP endpoint answering, database reachability from the instance, and
keyless cataloguing through OCI Generative AI (16 objects described by the
instance principal, no API key). One caveat: the server was started by hand on
that run, because `resolve-db` deadlocked on a blocking `systemctl restart`. The
`--no-block` fix below removes the deadlock but has not yet completed an
unattended run; everything downstream of it is certified.

Nine applies to get there, each finding something no `terraform plan` can
catch, and each pinned by a test.

- **Fixed: the database could not be created.** One-way TLS on a public
  Autonomous Database requires an access-control list, and 0.1.7 had removed
  it. The list has to name the instance's public IP, so that address is now
  reserved up front and attached to the VNIC; the database is created after
  the instance, and `/opt/resolve-db.sh` looks the connection descriptor up at
  boot through the instance principal rather than Terraform baking it into
  cloud-init (which would be a dependency cycle).
- **Fixed: `LaunchInstance` returned 404-NotAuthorizedOrNotFound.** The stack
  took `availability_domains[0]`; a live Phoenix tenancy offers
  `VM.Standard.E2.1.Micro` in AD-3 only. It now asks each domain which shapes
  it offers and picks one that has the shape.
- **Fixed: `verify.sh` tore down a successful plan.** `wait_job` printed its
  progress on stdout, which the caller was capturing, so the state it returned
  was `ACCEPTED\r   IN_PROGRESS\rSUCCEEDED` and never matched. It also split
  the job log on commas instead of decoding it, dropping the `Suggestion:` and
  `Request Target:` lines that say what actually failed.
- **The first boot is faster, and the endpoint check waits long enough.** The
  fourth run applied cleanly and then failed the endpoint check. Oracle spends
  most of ten minutes provisioning the database, and the lookup that waits for
  it was running *after* the pip install rather than underneath it — the two
  waits added up. The lookup now starts at the top of `runcmd` and blocks on a
  marker the install writes, so the install is off the critical path; the
  lookup uses the OCI Python SDK already in the venv instead of installing the
  CLI; pip no longer upgrades itself first, prefers wheels, and skips a cache
  nothing reads twice. `verify.sh` waits fifteen minutes and says what it is
  waiting for.
- **The install no longer byte-compiles.** A fifth run applied cleanly and the
  endpoint still had not answered eighteen minutes into the boot. The database
  was `AVAILABLE` before the apply even returned, so the wait was not the
  database -- it was pip compiling the OCI SDK's thousands of modules on one
  burstable OCPU. `--no-compile` removes that; Python compiles what it imports,
  and this venv imports a fraction of it. The SDK is also now installed only
  when something needs it, which takes it off the boot path entirely for a
  stack pointed at your own database. `verify.sh` takes `SHAPE`, `OCPUS` and
  `MEMORY_GBS`, and on a timeout it prints what the instance was doing before
  tearing it down.
- **Fixed: a second run in the same tenancy could not apply.** The dynamic
  group, the policy and the database name were all derived from
  `md5(compartment_ocid)`, which is the same on every run in that compartment.
  One leftover from an earlier run -- a destroy that did not finish -- and the
  next apply failed with *"DynamicResourceGroup with the same displayName
  already exists"* and *"a database named sg... already exists"*. All three are
  now keyed on the VCN's OCID, which is unique to the apply. The database's
  display name is too, which also stops the boot-time lookup resolving an
  abandoned database instead of this one. `verify.sh` reports leftovers before
  it starts, and the README says how to remove them.
- **Fixed: cloud-init died before it ever reached the install.** Seven applies
  in, an SSH into a still-running instance showed why the endpoint never
  answered: no venv marker, no resolve log, no units -- but `/etc/schemagate.env`
  written, cloud-init dead inside `update_package_sources` on a signal, and a
  load average of 6.3 on a single core. `write_files` had run and `runcmd` never
  started. VM.Standard.E2.1.Micro is one burstable OCPU and one gigabyte of RAM,
  the Oracle Linux image ships no swap, and dnf's metadata refresh alone can
  exceed that. The boot now creates a 2 GB swapfile before any package work and
  no longer refreshes every repository's metadata to install one package that is
  in the base repository. Every earlier fix on this boot path had never once
  executed.
- **Fixed: one failed database lookup killed the endpoint permanently.** An
  instance ran for twelve hours with its database present and the MCP port
  dead. `/opt/resolve-db.sh` races an IAM policy that is created alongside the
  database and then has to propagate, and losing that race once was terminal:
  the oneshot failed, `Requires=` made that fatal for `schemagate.service`, and
  nothing retried either. The lookup now has `Restart=on-failure` and keeps
  trying, the server only `Wants=` it so a failure cannot block it for ever,
  and a successful lookup restarts the server rather than waiting for one.
- **`verify.sh` keeps its SSH key in `$HOME`.** It was in the work directory
  under `/tmp`, which Cloud Shell discards when it hands you a new machine
  after an idle disconnect. Twice that left an instance standing with no way
  back into it and no diagnosis. The apply now also prints the `ssh` line.
- **Fixed: the root cause. `write_files` aborted on the first file, every
  time.** `/etc/schemagate.env` was declared `owner: "root:opc"`. write_files
  runs *before* users-groups in cloud-init's init stage, so the opc group does
  not exist yet, and the module raised `getgrnam(): name not found: 'opc'` and
  stopped -- silently discarding every file after it. No `pick-extras.sh`, no
  `resolve-db.sh`, **no systemd units at all**, and then runcmd failed on files
  that were never written. This is why the MCP endpoint never answered on any
  run, on either shape, from the first apply to the eighth: nothing that would
  have served it was ever on disk. Ownership is set in runcmd now, where opc
  exists. Every other fix in this entry was to code that had never executed.
- **Fixed: the two units deadlocked each other.** With the files finally on
  disk, a live boot got further than ever and then stopped: `resolve-db`
  resolved the connection descriptor in 29 seconds and hung on the
  `systemctl restart schemagate` that followed it. `schemagate.service` is
  `After=` that unit, so systemd would not start the server until resolve-db
  finished -- and resolve-db could not finish until the restart returned.
  resolve-db sat in `activating (start)`, the server sat `inactive (dead)`, and
  the port never opened. Both in-unit restarts are `--no-block` now, which
  queues the job and returns.
- `tests/test_oci_stack.py` pins each of these. Twenty-one invariants now, and
  every one of them came from a failure a live apply produced.

## 0.1.7

**Applying the stack in a real tenancy for the first time found a bug that no
`terraform plan` can catch, because only the API rejects it. The apply still
does not complete** — the fix below moved the failure rather than removing it;
see *Still broken* at the end of this entry.

- **Fixed: the stack could never apply.** 0.1.4 added a service gateway so the
  database's access-control list could name the VCN — Oracle honours a VCN
  entry only when traffic arrives through one. The OCI API refuses a route
  table that holds both a service gateway for all services and an internet
  gateway default route: *"Internet Gateway target cannot be used together
  with Service Gateway target for All Services in the same routing table"*.
  The instance needs the internet gateway to install anything at all, so the
  service gateway is gone. Every apply since 0.1.4 would have failed here,
  after provisioning the database and before creating the instance.
- With the service gateway goes the VCN-scoped access-control list: naming the
  instance's public IP instead is circular, since cloud-init already carries
  the database's connection descriptor. The demo database this stack creates
  is therefore reachable over TLS with the ADMIN password and nothing else —
  it is created empty and destroyed with the stack, and the README says so
  plainly. New `adb_allowed_cidrs` narrows it, and `create_adb = false`
  against your own database remains the path for real data.
- **Fixed: `verify.sh` reported nothing when a job failed.** It waited with
  `oci resource-manager job get --wait-for-state`, which that subcommand does
  not accept; the non-zero exit tripped `set -e` and ran the teardown trap
  before any diagnostic printed, so a failed plan looked like the script
  silently skipping three steps. Every wait is now an explicit poll that
  prints the state it sees, and both failure paths dump the job's error lines.
- `tests/test_oci_stack.py` pins the routing rule and asserts `schema.yaml` and
  `variables.tf` declare the same variables.

**Still broken after this release.** Removing the access-control list made the
database itself invalid: with `is_mtls_connection_required = false` and no
list, Oracle rejects the create with *"One-way TLS connections require a
private endpoint or a public IP with an ACL"*. The apply now gets as far as the
database and fails there. Restoring the list needs the instance's public IP,
and the instance cannot precede the database because its cloud-init carries the
connection descriptor — so this needs a real change, not a parameter. Use the
Cloud Shell route in `oci/README.md` until then.

## 0.1.6

The stack's keyless cataloguing raced the permission that authorises it, and
there is now a script that proves a deployment works rather than asserting it.

- **Fixed: first-boot cataloguing raced its own IAM policy.** The dynamic
  group's matching rule needs the instance OCID, so Terraform cannot create the
  group or the Generative AI policy until the instance exists — by which time
  the instance is already running `catalog-once.sh`. Authorisation also takes
  minutes to propagate after the policy is written. The single attempt on first
  boot usually lost that race and failed with `NotAuthorizedOrNotFound`, which
  the stack logged and moved past, leaving a catalog with no descriptions in it.
  Cataloguing now retries for twelve minutes and restarts the server when it
  succeeds.
- The MCP endpoint now comes up *before* cataloguing rather than after, so the
  retry window no longer holds the service down.
- `oci/stack/verify.sh`: end-to-end certification of the stack in your own
  tenancy, through Resource Manager — the same path the Deploy button takes. It
  uploads the released zip, plans, applies, then checks the machine rather than
  the plan: the MCP port answers, the instance can reach the database through
  the service gateway, and cataloguing genuinely called OCI Generative AI
  through the instance principal. Destroys everything afterwards. It generates
  its own key and password and narrows both CIDRs to the calling shell.
- `tests/test_oci_stack.py` pins the cloud-init template contract and the
  ordering above; nothing else in the suite would have noticed either.

## 0.1.5

**PostgreSQL users on 0.1.1-0.1.4 should upgrade: their catalog was empty.**

- **Fixed: PostgreSQL reflected nothing at all.** 0.1.1 added an
  internal-schema filter for Oracle Autonomous Database and put `public` on
  the list, because `PUBLIC` is a pseudo-schema on Oracle. On PostgreSQL
  `public` is the user's entire database, so every schema was filtered out and
  `Catalog.bootstrap()` returned zero objects. Caught by running
  `scripts/certify_dialect.py` against a live PostgreSQL 16, which failed 7 of
  10 checks.
- Internal-schema detection now lives behind a per-dialect hook
  (`schemagate.dialects.is_internal_schema`) and applies only to the engine
  that defines it. A test asserts no cross-dialect list exists in
  `introspect.py`, because that is what caused this.
- **PostgreSQL 16 re-certified live**: certify script 10/10, plus the dialect
  and 260-object hostile suites.
- The OCI stack installs the driver matching your database URL instead of
  always Oracle, so `create_adb = false` with a PostgreSQL, SQL Server or MySQL
  URL now works rather than failing at import.
- Stack: `shape_config` for Flex shapes (A1.Flex is the other Always Free
  option and would 400 without it), a selectable availability domain for the
  "out of host capacity" case, GenAI policy scoped to the compartment instead
  of the tenancy, and preconditions that catch a missing password or database
  URL at plan time.

## 0.1.4

An audit of the OCI stack — which had never been applied — found that its
headline feature never ran and that a default deploy could not have worked.

- **Fixed: `describe --provider oci` ignored instance-principal auth.** On an
  OCI VM there is no `~/.oci/config`; the machine authenticates as itself. The
  CLI built `OCIGenAIProvider` with the default `auth="config"`, failed with
  `ConfigFileNotFound`, and the stack's `|| true` swallowed it — so the
  first-boot cataloguing the README promised silently never happened. The CLI
  now honours `OCI_CLI_AUTH`, as every other OCI tool does.
- **The stack now creates a service gateway.** The database's access-control
  list admits the VCN, and Oracle only honours a VCN entry when traffic arrives
  through a service gateway. Without one the database refused the VM's
  connections — the stack applied cleanly and never worked.
- The DSN is now selected as the LOW, server-authentication profile rather than
  `profiles[0]`, which can be a mutual-TLS profile that thin-mode
  python-oracledb cannot use without a wallet.
- `adb_version` defaults to 19c: Always Free offers it in every home region,
  while 26ai and 23ai exist in only a few and 23ai stops being a valid value in
  December 2026.
- Database, dynamic-group and policy names are suffixed from the compartment,
  so a second deploy in one tenancy no longer collides.
- The image lookup asserts it found one instead of indexing an empty list.
- `allowed_cidr` and `ssh_cidr` are now separate and have **no defaults** — the
  MCP endpoint has no authentication of its own, so the stack refuses
  `0.0.0.0/0` rather than shipping an internet-facing schema browser.
- Password validation matches Oracle's actual rule, including its rejection of
  passwords containing "admin".
- cloud-init: online `firewall-cmd` instead of `firewall-offline-cmd`, an env
  file the documented re-run command can actually read, and cataloguing output
  captured to `/var/log/schemagate-catalog.log` instead of discarded.
- The stack README now states plainly that it has not been applied end to end,
  and lists the home-region, tenancy-admin and credential-exposure caveats.

## 0.1.2

One click onto Oracle Cloud, and the OCI provider no longer truncates.

- **Deploy to Oracle Cloud.** Resource Manager accepts a stack from a zip URL,
  so the button in the README gives the same one-click install a Marketplace
  listing would, with no partner membership, supplier registration or separate
  tenancy involved. Each release now carries `schemagate-oci-stack.zip` with the
  Terraform at the zip root, which is what Resource Manager reads.
- `oci/quickstart.sh`: schemagate against an existing Autonomous Database from
  OCI Cloud Shell in about a minute — no VM, no Terraform, no API key.
- `oci/stack/` catalogues on first boot: a dynamic group and policy let that one
  instance call OCI Generative AI through its instance principal, so
  descriptions are written with no key and no prompt leaving the tenancy.
- **Fixed: descriptions arrived truncated from OCI.** `_oci_text` read only the
  first content part of a reply, so every Gemini description on a live run was
  cut off mid-sentence at about ten tokens and business-language recall fell
  twenty points with nothing logged. It now walks every response shape the
  service returns.
- A reply that stops mid-clause is retried with real headroom, and anything
  still short is collected on `SchemaDescriber.truncated` and raised as one
  `RuntimeWarning`. A provider that caps output can no longer degrade a catalog
  in silence.

## 0.1.1

Oracle, certified live on Autonomous Database 26ai — and the AI cataloging
that makes retrieval work on real, cryptic schema names.

- **Oracle certified live** on Oracle AI Database 26ai (Autonomous Database):
  `certify_dialect.py` 10/10, the native `VECTOR(512, FLOAT32)` store
  conformance suite, and the dialect suite. Stress-tested against a live
  127-object, 3-domain schema with ~7M rows.
- `SCHEMAGATE_CONNECT_ARGS` reaches every entry point — `introspect.reflect()`,
  the CLI, `Catalog.bootstrap()`, the MCP server and `OracleStore` — so a
  wallet-protected ATP connects everywhere, not just in the certify script
  (`introspect.connect_args_from_env` / `engine_from_url`).
- Per-dialect reflection hooks (`schemagate.dialects`): on Oracle, Autonomous
  Database service schemas (`ORACLE_MAINTAINED`, APEX/ORDS/OML/ODI) are left
  out of reflection, and column types SQLAlchemy reports as `NULL`
  (XMLTYPE, JSON, VECTOR, object types) are recovered from the data dictionary.
- Fixed on live 26ai: the JSON payload `OracleStore` reads back can arrive
  already decoded by the driver.
- **Provider matrix for AI cataloging.** `OCIGenAIProvider` — OCI Generative AI
  with no API key (`~/.oci/config`, resource or instance principal); Cohere and
  generic chat shapes, dedicated endpoints, embeddings. `LocalProvider` — a
  small instruct model via `transformers`, fully offline. `schemagate describe
  --provider oci | local` join `anthropic | openai | gemini | auto` and the
  keyless paste-into-any-chat flow.
- Descriptions without an API key: `Catalog.describe_prompt()` renders one
  prompt for any chat window; `Catalog.describe()` accepts the JSON reply as a
  plain dict; `schemagate describe` does both from the shell and saves into the
  `describe` block of a catalog config, which `select`, `studio` and the MCP
  server all read (`schemagate.config`).
- The `describe` prompt now also asks for the everyday words a person would use;
  they are indexed for retrieval and kept out of the prompt DDL. Blind
  benchmark across six schemas: business-language recall rises from ~56% on
  identifiers alone to ~92% with descriptions (`tests/test_business_language.py`).
- `Catalog.__len__` and `Catalog.objects()`.
- `python -m schemagate` works.
- `pip install schemagate[ai]` no longer drags in the ~100 MB `oci` SDK; that
  lives in `schemagate[oci]`.
- README hero image, badges, SECURITY/CONTRIBUTING/CITATION, MCP registry
  manifest.

## 0.1.0

First release. (Published for one day as `ashiq` 0.1.0 before the rename;
that name now installs this package and warns.)

- Identity-scoped schema selection: reflect any SQLAlchemy dialect, retrieve
  with BM25 + vector fusion, expand foreign keys, filter by caller before the
  model sees anything.
- Offline default embedder, deterministic across processes and machines.
- Optional AI cataloguing through Claude, GPT, Gemini or any callable; nothing
  is sent unless you ask, and never row data.
- `OracleStore` on Oracle 23ai native VECTOR (statically verified; live run
  pending).
- `schemagate` command line with a no-database demo.
- MCP server (`python -m schemagate.mcp_server`) and a LangChain retriever.
- Unicode identifiers, including CJK, with accent folding.
- Backup and staging copies (`_bkp`, `_old`, `_v2`, `stg_` ...) are ranked
  below the object they shadow, unless named outright.
- `schemagate studio`: a local page on your own database, and a hosted demo of the
  same page running a JavaScript port of the selector (parity-tested).
- Claims-warehouse star schema fixture: grain, SCD2, role-playing dates,
  bridges, fifteen backup copies.
- Six benchmark schemas (commerce, clinical, claims warehouse, bank ledger,
  IoT telemetry, hostile), 430+ tests, dialect certification script,
  TESTING.md.
