        * Then by overlap with the question, over the column's name, its
          comment and any sampled values, which are the three places a
          column's meaning is written down. Name matches count double: a

          do, and that is what diluted IDF on the 1,245-object schema.
        * Ties break on declaration order, so the result is deterministic for
          a given question and schema rather than dependent on dict order.

        Selection and rendering are separate on purpose: whatever is chosen
        comes back in declaration order, so the DDL still reads like the DDL.
