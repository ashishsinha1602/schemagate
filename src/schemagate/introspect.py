    """The distinct values of short string columns, when there are few.

    This exists because of a specific wrong answer, and it is worth stating
    plainly: a model was handed `status VARCHAR(30)` and wrote
    `WHERE status = 'DENIED'`. The rows say `denied`. The query was correct
    in every way a schema can express, and returned nothing -- which reads as
    "there are no denied claims", not as a mistake. Nothing in a catalog can
    tell a model the casing of a value it has never seen.

    Bounded on purpose, because this is the only place the library reads
    rows: short string columns only, one query each, `LIMIT max_distinct + 1`
    so a high-cardinality column costs one small query and is then dropped
    rather than pulled into memory. A column that fails -- no privilege, a
    view that cannot be scanned -- is skipped, not fatal: this is an
    enrichment, and reflection must still finish without it.

    `deadline` is the bound that matters off the developer's laptop. The cost
    here is round trips -- one count per table plus one query per candidate
    column -- and the number of them is set by the schema while their price is
    set by the network. A few hundred columns at laptop latency is nothing; the
    same schema behind an Autonomous Database wallet is minutes, spent behind a
    "Connecting..." with no way to tell a slow link from a hang. Past the
    deadline this returns what it has and reflection continues: values are an
    enrichment, and a catalog missing some of them beats a connect that never
    finishes.

    `conn` is reused across tables, which is tidier but is not that fix --
    SQLAlchemy pools connections, so the per-table `engine.connect()` this
    replaced was already checking the same DBAPI connection back out of the
    pool rather than opening a new one.
