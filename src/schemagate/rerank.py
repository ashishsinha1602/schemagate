"""Let a model make the final choice, after the maths has narrowed the field.

Selection on identifiers is strong when the question shares vocabulary with
the schema and halves when it does not: measured recall@6 is 100% across five
test schemas and 50% on the one where every question is phrased in business
words rather than table words. That is the honest ceiling of matching names,
and no amount of tuning BM25 gets past it -- "doctors" and `provider` share no
characters at all.

A model does get past it, and it does not need to read the whole database to
do so. The maths already puts the right table in the top twenty almost always;
what it gets wrong is the order within those twenty. So this reranks a short
candidate list rather than replacing retrieval:

    219 objects  --maths-->  20 candidates  --model-->  6

which costs one small call on a list of one-line summaries, not a prompt
containing the schema. It is also why this cannot leak: reranking only ever
sees candidates that ``select()`` already filtered by principal, so a table
the caller may not see is not in the list to be promoted.

Failure is never worse than not using it. A model that errors, times out or
answers with something unparseable leaves the original order untouched.
