"""Embedder protocol and the zero-dependency default.

HashingEmbedder is not a placeholder. Schema selection matches questions
against identifier-heavy text (CUST_ORDER_LINE_ITEMS_V, ID_CUSTOMER),
where subword overlap carries more signal than sentence semantics. It needs
no model download, no API key, no fitting, and is byte-for-byte deterministic
across machines -- which also makes cached vectors portable.

Swap in SentenceTransformerEmbedder, or any object satisfying the Embedder
protocol, if your questions share little vocabulary with your schema.
