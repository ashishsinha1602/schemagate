"""Turn what people actually have into something SQLAlchemy can open.

The Connect box asks for a SQLAlchemy URL, and most people do not have one.
An Oracle team has a wallet zip and a TNS alias. A SQL Server team has a JDBC
string from a config file. Telling them to hand-translate it is where the tool
stops being usable, and it is the kind of translation that is easy to get
subtly wrong -- a JDBC Oracle URL and a SQLAlchemy one disagree about where
the service name goes, and the failure reads as a login error.

Two things come out of here, always together:

    url, connect_args = resolve(spec)
    engine = create_engine(url, connect_args=connect_args)

`connect_args` matters because some connections cannot be a URL at all. An
Autonomous Database needs a wallet directory and a wallet password, which have
nowhere to live in a URL, so the URL degenerates to `oracle+oracledb://@` and
everything real travels beside it. That is the same shape
`SCHEMAGATE_CONNECT_ARGS` has always used; this builds it rather than making
someone write the JSON.
