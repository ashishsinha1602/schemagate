"""PostgreSQL: what the Inspector cannot tell us.

Three things cost prompt budget or accuracy on a real PostgreSQL database and
the Inspector cannot help with any of them.

* ``get_schema_names()`` returns the catalog schemas alongside the user's.
  ``pg_catalog`` and ``information_schema`` are hundreds of objects nobody
  asks questions about, and they would be indexed and scored like any table.
  ``public`` is emphatically NOT internal here -- it is where most databases
  keep everything, which is exactly why this list is per-dialect.

* Extensions bring their own tables. PostGIS installs ``spatial_ref_sys``
  (~8,500 rows of projection definitions) and a ``topology`` schema;
  TimescaleDB installs ``_timescaledb_catalog`` and ``_timescaledb_internal``;
  pg_stat_statements, pgAgent and others do the same. None of them are the
  user's data, and ``pg_depend`` knows which objects an extension owns, so we
  do not have to guess from names.

* SQLAlchemy reports a type it has no class for as NULL with a warning --
  ``geometry`` and ``geography`` from PostGIS, ``vector`` from pgvector,
  ``hstore``, ``citext``, domains, enums and range types. A column whose type
  reads NULL in the prompt is worse than useless: the model cannot tell an
  integer from a polygon. ``format_type()`` gives the name the user would
  write, which is the name that belongs in the DDL.
