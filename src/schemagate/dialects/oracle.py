#: engine -> owner -> {(table, column): rendered type}. One query per SCHEMA,
#: not per table and not per database.
#:
#: The middle option is the point, and getting it wrong cost a boot. Per table
#: is a round trip each time to a cloud database for an answer that does not
#: change. But the whole-database version that replaced it dropped the
#: `owner = :o` predicate, and that predicate is the one the data dictionary
#: can actually use: without it `all_tab_columns` is a scan across every
#: schema the caller can see. On a local Oracle with 219 objects that is
#: invisible. On an Autonomous Database exposing ~1,500 objects it is not, and
#: it runs during reflection at boot, so the endpoint simply never opens.
#:
#: Per owner keeps both properties: bounded and indexed like the per-table
#: query, and asked once for a whole schema like the per-database one. A
#: reflection over 219 objects in one schema issues one query, the same as
#: before; a reflection over ten schemas issues ten, not two thousand.
#:
#: Keyed on the engine object, weakly. The obvious `id(engine)` is wrong in a
#: way that is quiet and awful: CPython reuses the id of a collected object,
#: so an engine opened after an earlier one was garbage collected can land on
#: the same key and be handed the *previous database's* column types without
#: issuing a single query. Reproduced in a loop -- a fresh engine got
#: `geometry(Point,4326)` for a column that was `integer`. A weak key cannot
#: collide, because the entry cannot outlive the engine it describes, and it
#: also stops the cache growing forever in a process that opens engines.
