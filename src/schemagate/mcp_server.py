"""MCP server: let an agent ask schemagate which tables it needs.

Any MCP-capable client -- Cursor, Windsurf, Zed, an agent you
wrote -- can call ``select_schema`` and get back the compact DDL for exactly
the objects a question needs, already filtered to what the caller may see.
The agent then writes SQL against that, and never sees the rest.

    pip install 'schemagate[mcp]'
    SCHEMAGATE_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://localhost/app python -m schemagate.mcp_server

A desktop MCP client, in its config file::

    {"mcpServers": {"schemagate": {
        "command": "python", "args": ["-m", "schemagate.mcp_server"],
        "env": {"SCHEMAGATE_DATABASE_URL": "postgresql://localhost/app"}}}}

To host it for a team instead of one desktop::

    SCHEMAGATE_MCP_TRANSPORT=streamable-http SCHEMAGATE_MCP_PORT=8765 python -m schemagate.mcp_server

Identity: every tool takes ``principal`` and ``roles``. The server does not
guess who is asking -- if the client omits them, the caller is treated as
anonymous and sees only unrestricted objects. Fail closed.

Where the trust boundary is
---------------------------
Read this before exposing the server on a port. **The principal and roles are
asserted by the client, and this server believes them.** There is no
authentication here: no token, no session, no signature. Fail-closed protects
the caller who omits a role, not the one who invents it -- anyone who can
reach the transport can pass ``roles=["payroll"]`` and read what that role may
read. Since ``run_query`` returns rows rather than schema, that is data.

So it is safe exactly where the transport is: over stdio, where the only
caller is the desktop client on your own machine; or over HTTP **behind
something that authenticates the user and fills in the principal itself** --
a gateway, a proxy, your own service. Do not put the HTTP transport on a
network you do not control and rely on ``principal`` to keep people apart.
It is a scoping mechanism, not a lock.

The OCI stack narrows it to a CIDR you name and refuses ``0.0.0.0/0``, which
is a network control rather than an identity one. A shared secret is not yet
implemented.

Restrictions and hints come from ``SCHEMAGATE_CATALOG_CONFIG``, a JSON file::

    {"restrict": {"hr_compensation": ["payroll"]},
     "hint":     {"invoice_draft": "drafts only, not revenue"},
     "describe": {"v_stock_shortfall": "Items below their reorder level."}}

``describe`` is filled by ``schemagate describe`` (with a key, or by pasting
the prompt into any chat -- no key needed).

Staying up
----------
The index lives in memory after startup, so the database going away does
not take the server with it: ``select_schema`` keeps answering from the
last good reflection, and ``refresh_catalog`` reports failure instead of
raising. Every tool returns ``{"error": ...}`` for bad input rather than
letting an exception reach the transport. ``health`` tells a load balancer
or a person what state the server is in.
