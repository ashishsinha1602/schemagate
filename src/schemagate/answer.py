"""Turn a selection into an answer.

Selection is the part this library is careful about; answering is the part
everyone actually wants, and leaving it out made the pipeline look like it
stopped halfway. It genuinely does stop halfway -- a model has to write the
SQL -- so this module is the thin, explicit piece that closes the loop:

    question -> select() -> SQL from a model -> rows

Two things are deliberate here.

The SQL only ever sees the objects ``select()`` returned. That is what makes
the identity boundary mean something: a table the caller may not see is not
in the prompt, so the model cannot write SQL against it, and there is nothing
to filter out afterwards.

And the SQL is checked before it runs. A model asked for a query usually
writes a query, but "usually" is not a basis for handing generated text to a
database, so anything that is not a single read is refused rather than run.
