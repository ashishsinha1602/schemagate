"""AI-generated catalog descriptions.

Retrieval quality is limited by how much meaning the schema text carries.
``CUST_ORD_LN_T`` with columns ``ID``, ``QTY``, ``AMT`` tells a retriever
almost nothing, which is why the offline embedder scores 50% on questions
phrased in business words rather than identifier words.

A ``SchemaDescriber`` asks a model to write one sentence per object saying
what it holds and when to use it, and stores that on
``ObjectDoc.description``. That text is already part of ``embed_text()``,
so descriptions improve both vector and BM25 retrieval with no other change.

**Only schema metadata is sent.** Object names, column names, types,
nullability, existing comments, and foreign keys. No rows, no sample values,
no query results, no credentials -- ``ObjectDoc`` does not carry row data,
and ``_render`` cannot reach any. There is a test asserting this.

**A human hint always wins.** ``Catalog.hint()`` is applied after
descriptions and outranks them everywhere, so a wrong AI description can be
corrected without regenerating anything.

Descriptions cost money, so results are cached by content: an object is
re-described only when its structure or the model changes.
