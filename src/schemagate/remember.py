"""Remember the last connection, so restarting the Studio is not retyping it.

The Studio holds its connection in the server process and nowhere else. That
is fine until the process ends -- and it ends often, because it is a local
tool people Ctrl+C and restart. Every restart put the page back on "Nothing
connected yet" and made someone re-enter a URL, or worse, a wallet directory
plus two passwords. The connection was never lost in the sense of a dropped
socket; it was simply never written down.

So it gets written down. What is stored is the connect request itself -- the
same body the page POSTs to /api/connect -- because that is the thing that is
replayable. Storing a resolved SQLAlchemy URL instead would lose the wallet
fields, which do not fit in a URL and are the case that hurts most to retype.

On secrets
----------
This file can contain a database password and a wallet password. That is a
real trade -- a credential on disk is a credential that can be read -- and it
is not one to make on someone's behalf, in a tool whose whole pitch is that it
reads your schema and stores nothing. So **nothing is written unless it is
asked for**: tick "Remember this connection" in the page, or start with
`--remember`. Without that the connection lives in the process, as it always
has, and a restart asks again.

When it is asked for:

* It is written 0600, and to the user's own home directory.
* A *connection* never carries an AI provider key. A saved *model* does --
  that is what saving a model is for -- in the same 0600 file, and only when
  someone clicks Save in Settings.
* `--forget` deletes what is there.

Replaying is not gated the same way: if the file exists, someone already said
yes to it, and asking a second time on every start would just be a prompt to
click through.

On Windows, `chmod` cannot express 0600 -- the file inherits the ACL of the
user profile directory instead, which is user-scoped but not the same promise.
`describe()` says so rather than implying a protection that is not there.
