"""Finance and telemetry, run through one contract.

Every domain fixture answers the same questions: does recall hold, does the
real table beat its copies, does scoping hold, and do descriptions lift the
questions phrased in business words. Parametrising over fixtures means a
new domain is one import away from the full treatment.
