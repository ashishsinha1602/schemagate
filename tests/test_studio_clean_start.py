"""What the Studio opens on when you just run `schemagate studio`.

Until 0.1.18 a bare launch loaded the bundled 42-object sample schema and the
header announced "connected to your database" over it. Both halves were wrong
in the same direction: someone who ran the command to point the tool at their
own data got invented tables labelled as theirs, and the only way to tell was
to recognise that `sales_order` was not a table they had.

So: nothing loads unless it was asked for, and the server never claims a
