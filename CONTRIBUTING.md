# Contributing

Bug reports with a schema that breaks selection are the most useful thing you
can send. The six test schemas in `tests/schema_fixture_*.py` exist because
each one broke something; yours probably will too.

## Setup

    git clone https://github.com/ashishsinha1602/schemagate
    cd schemagate
    pip install -e '.[dev]'
    pytest -q                      # ~660 tests, about a minute
    python tests/bench.py          # recall and token gates the README quotes

Node is only needed for `tests/test_js_parity.py` (the browser port); it skips
without it. The Studio is rebuilt with `python studio/build.py`.

## Rules the tests enforce

- No vendor-specific SQL in reflection; only SQLAlchemy's Inspector. Vendor
  SQL lives in `dialects/` or `grants.py`.
- Anything touching visibility fails closed. There is one rule,
  `models.allowed`, and both the object and column checks use it. Two copies
  of a visibility rule drift, and a drifted ACL is the failure this library
  exists to prevent.
- Nothing reads rows unless asked. `--values` is the single exception and it
  is off by default: reading rows is a different promise to make about
  someone's database than reading metadata.
- A restricted object must be absent from both the list and the DDL for a
  caller without the role. `tests/test_identity.py` and `test_isolation.py`.
- If you change ranking in Python, change `studio/schemagate.js` too; the
  parity test compares scores to 1e-9.
- Every fixture declares itself synthetic; no real schema names.
- `scripts/check_names.py` must stay clean.

## Adding a schema

Copy the shape of `tests/schema_fixture_finance.py`: DDL, hints, a restricted
object, golden questions with the objects they must retrieve, and a
description dict labelled as hand-written. Add it to `tests/bench.py`.

## Vendor SQL is not tested until an instance has run it

The grant readers in `grants.py` were written, unit-tested against fakes, and
then found wrong twice the first time they met a live PostgreSQL. One bug
would have silently disabled the PUBLIC rule; the other expanded nested roles
in the wrong direction and **over**-granted. Neither was reachable without a
server.

So if you touch `grants.py` or `dialects/`, say in the pull request which
engine and version you ran against. These are enough:

    docker run -d --name orafree -p 1521:1521 -e ORACLE_PASSWORD=secret \
      gvenzl/oracle-free:23-slim
    docker run -d --name pg16 -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=secret postgres:16

## Pull requests

One change per PR, tests included, CHANGELOG line added. Keep the README in
the voice it has; no marketing adjectives.

## Sign your commits

Add a `Signed-off-by` line to every commit:

    git commit -s -m "your message"

which appends

    Signed-off-by: Your Name <your@email>

That is the [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/)
1.1 -- the same one the kernel and Docker use. It says you wrote the patch, or
have the right to submit it, and that you are happy for it to ship under the
Apache-2.0 licence in `LICENSE`.

There is no CLA, and you keep the copyright in what you write. The sign-off is
asked for because without it nobody can tell later whether a contribution was
actually the contributor's to give -- and that question is much harder to
answer years after the fact than at the moment of the commit.

The project's name is not covered by the licence; see `TRADEMARK.md`.
